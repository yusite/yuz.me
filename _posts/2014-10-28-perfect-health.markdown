summary:    "The 6 elements that help people achieve perfect health. A theory from Bashar."

Let us talk about what is necessary to incorporate in your lives if you really want to lay a foundation for health.

Many of you really have heard many of these things quite often – they are not really new to you, but again many of you may tend to forget when you come across the idea whether it is yourself or someone else of a so-called specific disease.

You tend to forget the idea very often that it requires a very basic understanding to begin with to create an environment within your body that will in many cases simply prevent the onset of any kind of disease whatsoever.

These basic requirements again you have all heard them, but let us take a refresher course at this time and it is basically as follows.

## Oxygen

Many of you do not necessarily allow yourselves to get the full requirement of oxygen in your system – especially, no offense, in the way that your atmosphere happens to be at this time in terms of the fact that it is loaded with pollutants.

The idea of course is the oxygenation of the system is the primary fundamental key that allows all of your cells, the capacity to build themselves in the way that they need to be built.

Oxygenation of the system is the fundamental element to begin with and can to some degree be enhanced to the best of your ability by making at least an attempt to find some relatively clean environment, and or at least oxygenation of the system through the idea of deep breathing exercises, some kind of yoga practice, or at least some kind of restful meditation wherein there are deep, regular breaths or at least the idea of relaxation so that you are not  in that sense “panic breathing” which is short breaths not allowing the idea for oxygenation of the system to fully occur.

Number one than oxygen – oxygenation of the system.

## Hydration of the System

Do you have enough water? You are as physiological beings mostly water yet many of you will ingest many things that will actually divest you of the hydration of your system - dehydrate you.

And as many of you are beginning to understand many of the so-called symptomatology’s that you might begin to attribute to many exotic diseases are actually nothing more than the symptoms of dehydration.

In the sense then that your body is similar in a sense by analogy to a battery – if you do not have proper hydration, not enough water than your cells in that sense can burn out, short out, you can become in that sense dry like a battery and cease to function, cease to become electrically conductive.

And in that sense also lack of hydration – lack of water in the system will not allow your cellular structure to flush the toxins in your system from the system and this can cause many forms of build-up that will allow the immunological system and many cellular and enzymatic functions to cease.

Thus again causing many different kinds of symptomatology’s that can then open the door and lead the way to opportunistic organisms to bring about more and more complete forms of disease.

So, the second idea is hydration of the system. Each and every one of you must find that it will be generally acceptable to have between one and two quarts of water a day otherwise you will find you may not really readily have enough.

Now of course every single individual is different, but you must understand something very important, when you are actually thirsty that is your body’s final signal that you do not have enough water.

If you had proper hydration you would rarely ever be thirsty so use that as a marker.

## Exercise

You have heard this of course many times and again it is of paramount importance and is not to be taken lightly – exercise.

Movement. Movement is like the ability to pump the body to allow the muscles to function as pumps for the cellular structures. To allow the water to flush the toxins from the system to allow there to be energetic revitalization and allow there to be strengthening of the muscular and skeletal structures to utilize all the different mineralogical elements that are going into the body and to allow them to act as building blocks nutritionally.

Exercise and movement also in that sense will be representative of being active – of being energetic – of flowing energy through you rather than allowing it to sit around and build up and convert itself into mass in that sense what you would call “waiting to move”.

In that sense in your language then the analogy of simply putting on weight because you are “waiting/weighting” to do something the idea then is to understand that *oxygen* and *hydration* and *movement* are critical.

## The Reduction of Stress

Also then very important the reduction of stress in the system. Again many of the so-called symptoms that many of you attribute to the beginnings of disease are simply nothing more than the side effects of undue stress in your lives.

We would highly and strongly recommend that you find in any way, shape, or form to reduce the stress in your lives and if that means letting go of those things such as work situations and so forth that you know in your heart of hearts do not serve you – I would recommend that you do so.

Or at least use your imagination to find a way to convert that situation into something more exciting, more enjoyable, more relaxing for you. Reduction of stress is of paramount importance in your society.

## Elimination of toxins

The actual attempt at elimination of whatever toxins may already be in the system – removal of the toxins from the environment you are in – removal of the toxins – cleansing of the system for the buildup of toxins that may already be in the body is also of critical importance.

And there are many different kinds of cleansing rituals that one can take advantage of to allow the system of the body to be cleansed out from the build-up that may have occurred over time, and to allow yourself to remove from the body many different kinds of heavy metal poisonings.

And to allow yourself to pay attention to what it is you put in your body in terms of the pesticides and the heavy metal toxicity that may exist side by side with many of your food stuffs. So, removal of the toxins from your system is also of paramount importance.

## Lightening up your diet

The idea also of lightening up your diet in many ways especially in that in your society you have many different kinds of hormone imbalances and toxic substances that have been injected and added to many of your food stuffs.

Lightening up your diet will at the very least assist your body by the ingestion of more and more food stuffs that contain higher amounts of water such again as the vegetable food stuffs in that sense that are *mostly water just like your body*, and eaten in *raw, fresh, state as organic as possible will also be of great assistance in lightening up your energy and allowing for cleansing of the system.*

Some small amounts for certain individuals again where necessary of protein perhaps even in meat form is acceptable from time to time, but we would suggest that you do not overdo it.

Especially in this day and age on your planet where you will find that many of the protein meat substances on your planet as we have said are heavily laden with all sorts of toxins, so be very cautious about that idea.

And also understand that as you do accelerate your energy, as you do accelerate your systems, it will be less often that you will need such support and you will find yourself being *highly energized by less and less and less*.

And the more *natural* your food is in that sense – the more capable it is of giving you – of delivering nutrients that you need and energizing the system so that you actually need less food.

So you will find that these things will work hand in hand that as you clarify your system – *give it oxygen, give it water, reduce the stress, so on and so forth* your body will be more receptive to the nutrients that are there in your natural foods, and as you then feed it more *naturally*, you will find that you will be energized and require far *less*.

## Conclusion

So these ideas are simply the foundation of health and if you will allow yourself to recognize that these are very simple things that can be added to your life you will understand that in shall we just say for analogy’s sake 99.9999999 percent of the cases – these six ideas alone will eliminate almost any chance you will ever have of contracting any kind of disease in your life at all.

So when you talk about the idea of how do we cure Cancer, how do we cure Aids, how do we cure this, how do we cure that? That’s how you do it!

By changing the lifestyle in that way, and making sure your body has the foundational things it needs so that you will simply never get these things, because the body in and of itself has the natural intelligence to never bring about these kinds of diseases if you simply supply it with the immediate natural fuels that it needs which are oxygen and water and lack of stress and lightness of food in that sense.

Plain and simple that’s really all it will take for most of the things and most of the ailments you find that exist upon your planet.
