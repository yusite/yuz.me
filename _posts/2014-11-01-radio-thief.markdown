A friend of Darryl is a musician and passionate about music. One of the things that he loved to do was listen to music on the radio in his car while driving around the city. He was passionate about buying a certain radio because it delivered the best quality sound. But he didn't have enough money to buy that and saw no other ways to get a hold of it.

So, by following the idea of **acting on your highest excitement to the best of your ability**, he bought the next radio down he could afford that was still a representative of his excitement, it was a representative of his excitement that he could attain, **he could act on**, even though he could not get the one he initially really prefer.

He had that radio installed on his automobile. One week later, a thief broke into the car, damaged the dashboard, stole the radio and ran away.

Many people would invalidate this, and would say: "This is negative"; "This is bad"; "Why did this happen to me"; "Some thing must be wrong"; "I am invalidating myself for having created this"; "I thought I was more spiritual than this". That is the **trap** you fall into. There is nothing unspiritual about what just described, **Nothing!**

Because this person knew that, he stayed in the positive state, and said: **"I don't know how this serves me, but it must, because I prefer that it does! I prefer that this serves me in a positive way, I have no idea how this is going to serve me, but I know that it must."** So by staying in that state, he reported the theft to the insurance company, got reimbursed for the radio, and also got money to repair the dashboard where the damage was done.

He chose a particular auto-repair shop, went to the auto-repair shop, the auto-repair person looked at the damage and said: "you know, it looks bad, but it really isn't that bad, I can repair that in a jiffy." and did so, and did so **so quickly** that they did not even charge the person for it.

Now the person was standing there and said: "I have the money to replace the radio I had bought, but I still have the money that I was going to use to repair the car, but now I don't need to spend that way", and when he took both amount, and put them together, to the penny, It was **exactly** the amount that he need to buy the original radio he was originally passionated about.

That's how it works when you allow it to. If he had gone into the negative vibration: "Oh, this is terrible"; "I thought I was more spiritual than this"; "This is negative"; "This is bad"; "I invalidate this". Then he probably wouldn't have gotten the same amount of money from the insurance company, might have gone to an auto-repair shop that would have charged him double for doing something that someone else could do for free. He would have attracted like vibration to like vibration, and would have a negative experience, because he put a negative meaning to it, but he didn't.

Because he put the positive meaning to it, even though he couldn't fathom how it was going to serve him, it did. And it didn't matter what the thief's intention was, it didn't matter that the thief might have been coming from negative fear based scenarios of being deprived and thinking that that thief has to steal in order to have, in order to feel powerful, because it didn't affect the reality of this person who stayed in the positive state.

**Everything that happens in your life is a gift, and if you treated that way, you will experience that way, and spend the rest of your life unwrapping presents.**
